## Project Introduction
This project is a customs inspection commission business management system, mainly including functions such as commission registration, import and export, upload, review, quotation, bill review, bill sending, invoicing, report registration, automatic electronic report sending, paper report mailing registration, and payment management, aiming to improve business management efficiency and quality.

### Operating Environment
- .net framework 4.8
- Windows Server 2012 or above
- MS SQL Server 2012 or above
## Business Requirements
### Commission Registration Function
The sampler enters the commission information in Lims and must enter the contact person's mobile phone number. The effective date of the commission must be specified.
### Commission Export and Import
The sampler can export commission information from Lims and import it into the business management system.
The system will automatically determine whether it is a long-term customer or a short-term customer based on the "commissioning unit" and associate the account period and discount to automatically calculate the payment deadline.
Payment deadline = sample delivery date + 7 working days. If the commissioning unit has a contract, the payment deadline will be determined according to the payment period stipulated in the contract, and the payment deadline will be the end of the payment period + 15 working days.
The commissioning unit information is maintained in the "customer management".
### Commission Upload Function
The sampler can scan the paper commission form to generate a PDF file and upload the corresponding commission form to the business management system.
### Commission Review Function
The reviewer checks the business management system data based on the paper commission form. The process of checking and modifying in Lims directly must be specified.
### Commission Quotation Function
The quotation personnel select one or more sample data for a commissioning enterprise and choose a discount to generate a bill.
Online Bill Review Function
The bill is reviewed online according to the rules.
Bill review rules: Ma Yanyan is 20% off or more (including 20% off), Liu Xing and Zhang Wengui are 30% off or more (including 30% off), Cao Xizhong and Liu Xing are below 30% off (excluding 30% off), and two people approve at the same time.
### Automatic Bill Sending Function
The customer service personnel send the approved bills to the customer for confirmation.
The system automatically sends a bill link to the customer via SMS. The bill has a business chapter watermark, and the customer can download the bill by themselves.
If there are no objections to the bill, the customer can confirm the bill and pay the corresponding fee.
Customer service personnel can manually supplement or resend.
### Invoicing Function
The finance personnel issue invoices based on the bank's incoming bills and verify the bills, filling in the invoice.
### Several Ways to Generate Bills
Guohuan's commission form
Guohuan's commission form sample number starts with flxx-e
Guohuan charges separately for each test item
Calculate according to the explanation in the table below based on the selected commission form test items

When generating bills, users can upload PDF files.
Guohuan bills do not require approval from leaders and are automatically approved by the system and enter the verification stage.
1. Zijin's order
Zijin's order refers to the "special request description" field that contains "Zijin". When generating bills, users can enter the total amount after discount and the total amount received, and can also upload PDF files. Zijin's bills do not require approval from leaders and are automatically approved by the system and enter the verification stage.
2. Japanese-style order
The calculation method of the Japanese-style order is similar to that of Guohuan, and it is also calculated in the form of "enterprise-package" to calculate fees. Specific enterprise-package standards will be provided separately. Note: If the custom order number field contains "Quality Control Sample", this sample will not be charged.
3. Market Bureau order
The Market Bureau order starts with "ff". Bills can be generated by importing an Excel file (the main field in the Excel file is the sample number). When generating bills, users can enter the payment unit and the actual amount received, and upload PDF files. Market Bureau bills do not require approval from leaders and are automatically approved by the system and enter the verification stage.
4. Ordinary order
When generating bills, users can enter a uniform discount, or allow users to modify the discount for individual samples.
